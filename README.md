# object_detection
A PyTorch implementation of a YOLO v3 Object Detector This repo serves as a driver code for my research. I just graduated college, and am very busy looking for internship / fellowship roles before eventually applying for a masters. I won't have the time to look into issues for the time being. Thank you.

This repository contains code for a object detector based on YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement, implementedin PyTorch. The code is based on the official code of YOLO v3, as well as a PyTorch port of the original code, by marvis. One of the goals of this code is to improve upon the original port by removing redundant parts of the code (The official code is basically a fully blown deep learning library, and includes stuff like sequence models, which are not used in YOLO). I've also tried to keep the code minimal, and document it as well as I can.
