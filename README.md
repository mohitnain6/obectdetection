# object_detection

This repository contains code for a object detector based on YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement, implementedin PyTorch. The code is based on the official code of YOLO v3, as well as a PyTorch port of the original code, by marvis. One of the goals of this code is to improve upon the original port by removing redundant parts of the code (The official code is basically a fully blown deep learning library, and includes stuff like sequence models, which are not used in YOLO). I've also tried to keep the code minimal, and document it as well as I can.
